= Mifuchi as a webapp
Benjamin Garcia<benjamin.garcia@protonmail.com>

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/158198/mifuchi[Mifuchi] is a simple board game as an extension of chifumi. It add some rules to change classic game.
This application is an incubator to test and understand :

- CQRS architecture even if it's overengineering in this case
- Kotlin as default language to build, to code, well for everthing 🤟
- micronaut, but I would like to move to quarkus. this transformation from one framework to another one can confirm than I split correctly all application parts.

== How to

- use adoptJDK, or jdk-zulu or graalvm as you wish
- You need a Postgresql database. Connection data are in `application.yaml`. You can use a postgres docker image 🐳 .
- to build : `./gradlew assemblee`

[WARNING]
====
gradle scan build is enable by default, if you don't want this, disable it in build.gradle.kts 
====

Enjoy! 🥳

One source to understand CQRS is this video : https://youtu.be/qBLtZN3p3FU[📺]
